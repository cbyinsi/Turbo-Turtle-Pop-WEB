    <p>Welcome to <strong>Turbo Turtle Pop</strong> ("we", "our", or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information when you use our mobile application and related services (collectively, the "Service").

    </section>

    <section>

      <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers and device model, operating system, and version;</li>

        <li>Anonymous usage analytics (e.g., sessions, retention, in-app events).</li>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>1.3 Third-Party Data</h3>
      <p>We may receive information from third-party services integrated into the app (for example, analytics providers or advertising partners). The data those services collect is governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for purposes including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, maintaining and improving the Service;</li>
      <li>Delivering and personalizing content, features, and promotions;</li>
      <li>Analyzing usage patterns and trends to improve app performance and user experience;</li>
      <li>Diagnosing and fixing technical issues and crashes;</li>
      <li>Responding to support requests and communicating with you about updates or changes;</li>
      <li>Complying with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with vendors and service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., analytics, crash reporting, cloud hosting).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law or in response to legal process, or to protect our rights, property or safety.</li>
      <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, user data may be transferred as part of that transaction (with notice to affected users where required).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services and Advertising</h2>
    <p>The Service may use third-party analytics or advertising services (for example, Google Analytics for Firebase, AdMob, Unity Analytics, etc.). These third parties may collect and process data as described in their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies to understand how they handle data.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Non-personal and aggregated data may be retained longer for analytics and improvement purposes.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to help protect data collected through the Service from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secureâ€”so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Turbo Turtle Pop is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information about a child under 13, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

    <p>You may choose not to provide certain information, though that may limit your ability to use some features of the Service. You can also:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opt out of analytics collection where the third-party provider and your device permit it;</li>
      <li>Disable notifications via your device settings;</li>
      <li>Contact us to request access to, corrections of, or deletion of personal information we hold, subject to applicable laws and our obligations to retain certain information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be stored and processed in any country where we or our service providers operate. If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that data transferred to the U.S. or other countries may have different data protection rules.</p>

    <p>If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to request access to personal information we collect about you, request deletion, and opt out of sale of personal information (we do not sell personal information).
